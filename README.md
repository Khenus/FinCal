# Financier

## What issue are we trying to address?

Many finance management apps are full of bells and whistles that are largely irrelevant for teens and young adults (bank loans? Mortgage payments? What?). Hence, we wanted to create a relatively simple, no-frills expenses tracking app that suits the needs and lifestyle of this target audience.

* If you are just starting out on tracking your expenses, Financier aims to make the tracking process a breeze.
* If you are already in the habit of tracking, and wish to know more about where your money is going, Financier can show you detailed spending breakdowns.
* If you are forgetful and often owe your friends, Financier can keep help track of your debts.
* If you love food with friends, use Financier to collate orders, split costs and handle debts.

The next section details the app features that aim to achieve these goals.
